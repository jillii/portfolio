        <p>My focus was to streamline user experience - turn repetitive, manual data-entry into streamlined automations. Previously, populating the rates page meant uploading an XML file with all the rates to the backend. The page would then render the new rates. This system was clunky and unecessarily complex - a new XML would need to be made to update even a single rate. So, I created a data type for rates, which could be updated in the dashboard.</p>

        <p>Website updates should be quick and painless. Technology should help, not hurt.</p>
        <p>With help from my friends from design, I elevated the rates page user-experience with clear, well-styled rates tables.</p>

        <p>The idea had been proposed to a different dev team, and they estimated it would take about 230-280 hours. I built it in an eighth of the time. Sometimes all you need is a strong foundation to give you the flexibility to tackle curveballs.</p>
